            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">The Planning Inspectorate is committed to making its website accessible,
                in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Compliance status</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Whilst viewing the site at 1280px width and 400% zoom, two-dimensional scrolling is required to view content.
                Which may cause users who require bigger text to find it difficult if they must scroll to read long lines.
                This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.10 (Reflow).
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">We plan to resolve this by: 30th May 2025</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">The page titling is not descriptive and informative, this can result in navigation issues between browser tabs.
                This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.2 (Page Titled).
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">We plan to resolve this by: 30th May 2025</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">The focus order of the page is not always logical after selecting ‘continue’ on the form pages.
                This can cause confusion for users who require assistive technology to discern where they are on the page.
                This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.3 (Focus Order).
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">We plan to resolve this by: 30th May 2025</p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h3>
